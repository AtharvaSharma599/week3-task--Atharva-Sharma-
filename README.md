📌 Approach Taken :-
1. Loaded the Titanic dataset using pandas for data analysis.
2. Cleaned the data by handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns.
3. Performed exploratory analysis to understand data structure and key statistics.
4. Visualized important trends using matplotlib (e.g., survival by gender and class).
5. Derived insights and patterns from the data to support meaningful conclusions.

🚀 Steps to Run the Code (Jupyter Notebook using Visual Studio Code) :-
1. Install required tools:
   -Download and install Visual Studio Code
   -Install the Python and Jupyter extensions from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. Install necessary libraries.
3. Open the project folder in VS Code where your titanic_eda.ipynb file is saved.
4. Open the notebook file:
   -Click on titanic_eda.ipynb to open it inside VS Code.
5.Select the Python environment:
   -From the top-right corner, choose a Python interpreter (the environment where you installed the libraries).
6. Run the notebook:
   -Click on “Run All” or run each cell using Shift + Enter.
7. Ensure the dataset file (titanic.csv) is in the same folder to avoid file path errors.

🚧 Challenges Faced :-
1. Handling missing values without affecting data accuracy.
2. Selecting appropriate visualizations to represent insights clearly.
3. Managing data types and converting columns for analysis.
4. Interpreting correlations and patterns effectively.
5. Ensuring the dataset loaded correctly in different environments.
